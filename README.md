# Skin-care-assistant

**SkinDiseaseAI**: A Keras CNN project to classify 23 skin diseases from images.

---

## ⚠️ Project Status
**Work-in-Progress / Educational Project – Not a Medical Tool**  
This model is currently not fully functional and does not make accurate predictions. It serves as a starting point for further development using transfer learning.

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains a Keras Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) aimed at classifying 23 different skin conditions from input images. The current implementation is for learning and experimentation purposes.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- CNN model for skin disease classification
- Training scripts and notebooks
- Dataset preprocessing (if any)
- Placeholder for transfer learning improvements

---

## 📥 Installation
```bash
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shruti1-1/Skin-care-assistant.git

2. Create a Python virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3.To run the training notebook:
jupyter notebook sssss_.ipynb

Input: Images of skin conditions
Output: Predicted skin disease (currently unreliable)
